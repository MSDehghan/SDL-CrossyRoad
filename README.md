SDL-CrossyRoad
=============
**SDL-CrossyRoad** is a desktop game inspired by *Android CrossyRoad by yoldo games* created using SDL.

I just write this game as my last term project for C++ Course in University.

This game is published with `GPL v3` License. 

Genio
-------------
As you may have noticed already , i have used a library called **Genio**.

It is a simple and lightweight library for manipulating SDL in a way that you dont have to take care of low level SDL structs and functions.

It is written by the C++ Course TAs.
